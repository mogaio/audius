## Run you own Audius

Download the <a href="audius.app.hmtl" download>audius app</a> and upload it to you server.

## Install Audius as app

**Chrome desktop:**

1.  At the top right, click _More_.
2.  Click _More Tools_.
3.  Add the app:
		Windows users: Click _Add to taskbar_.
		Linux users: Click _Add to desktop_.
		Chromebook users: Click _Add to shelf_.

**Chrome android:**
Tap the menu button and tap _Add to homescreen_. The app is not yet optimized for mobile phones, it might work on tablets.

**Local HTML5:**
Since this player is a pure HTML5 app without server side code you can simply download the HTML and JS code and run it from a local file. You can also download the latest version from the [source code](#source-code) repository at github.

Why use the web version then?

1.  A click on "reload page" will pull the latests updates.
2.  I recognized that using this app from a local file blocks a lot of videos on YouTube (e.g. all Vevo videos) :(
3.  IndexDB, the browser database, does not work with file:// URLs, therefore Audius can not store your playlists etc. permanently.


## Development

Get the code and install all dependencies.
```
git clone git@github.com:select/audius.git
cd audius
npm install
```

Run the dev server (with hot module replacement).
```
npm start
```
Open http://localhost:8080/ to test.


Build a debug version that includes source maps and the full vue runtime.
```
npm run build
```
The build is located in `/dist-website`, open `index.html` to test.

Build a production version with with minimal runtime and without source maps
```
npm run build:prod:app
```
The build is also located in `/dist-website`, open `index.html` to test.

The chrome extension can be build with
```
npm run build:extension
```

### Media meta data object `MediaMetaData` 

This is the internal media data JSON fromat of Audius.
```
{
	id: 'ozD4h9HCHOY', // universal unique id
	title: 'Human readable title',
	duration: { h: 0, m: 58, s: '51' }, // optional if 'video' or 'audio'
	durationS: 3531, // duration in seconds;  optional if 'video' or 'audio'
	type: 'youtube', // available types: 'audio', 'video', 'vimeo'
	href: 'https://example.com/items/funny-video', // link to external page; not required for youtube
	thumbUrl: 'https://example.com/img/funny-video_100x75.jpg', // not req for yt
	start: 0, // optional time in seconds
	stop: 379, // optional time in seconds
	youtubeId: 'ozD4h9HCHOY', // youtube only
	vimeoId: '36579366', // vimeo only
	tracks: [ // optional
		{ // this is a full item with 
			trackId: 1,
			title: 'Kanan neni - Rokia Traoré - Wanita',
			duration: { d: 0, h: 0, m: 6, s: '19', ms: 0 },
			durationS: 379,
			id: 'Track1-ozD4h9HCHOY',
			type: 'youtube',
			start: 0,
			fullTitle: '1. Kanan neni : 00:00\r',
			durationAlbum: 3531,
			isTrack: true,
			youtubeId: 'ozD4h9HCHOY',
			stop: 379,
		},
	],
},
```

### Web scaper channels

A web scraper channel can be created by using URL patterns or a custom  object with data entries and functions.
The functions are evaled and executed in a sandbox in the Audius extension.

It must implement
- `getUrl()` which returns `{ type: '…', …data, responseTemplate: {type: '…'}}`
- a fuction that processes the data retrived from the call that `getURL` triggers

Available types:
- `ajaxJSON`
- `ajaxRaw`
- `scanOneUrl`
- `getYouTubeInfo`
- `mediaList` 

Example plugins
```
({
	pageIndex: 0,
	stepSize: 5,
	getUrl() { // return URL to request
		this.pageIndex += this.stepSize;
		return {
			type: 'ajaxJSON',
			data: `http://www.example.com/feeds/posts/summary?start-index=${this.pageIndex}&max-results=1&alt=json`,
			responseTemplate: { type: 'parse' },
		};
	},
	parse(data) {
		const datetime = data.feed.entry[0].published.$t;
		return {
			type: 'scanOneUrl',
			url: `http://www.example.com/search?updated-max=${encodeURIComponent(datetime.replace(/\.\d{3}-/, '-'))}&max-results=${this.stepSize}`,
		};
	},
})
```

```
({
	baseURL: 'https://example.com/api/',
	lastKey: '',
	getUrl() {
		return {
			type: 'ajaxJSON',
			data: !this.lastKey
				? this.baseURL
				: `https://example.com/api/items/get?older=${this.lastKey}`,
			responseTemplate: { type: 'parseResults' }, // call the parse function below with the results from ajaxJSON
		};
	},
	parseResults(data) {
		this.lastKey = data.items[data.items.length - 1].id;
		return { // return list of MediaMetaData objects
			type: 'mediaList',
			data: data.items.filter(item => /\.mp4$/.test(item.image)).map(item => ({
				id: `example-${item.id}`,
				title: item.title,
				type: 'video',
				thumbUrl: `https://thumb.example.com/${item.id}.jpg`,
				href: `https://example.com/top/${item.id}`,
				url: `https://vid.example.com/${item.image}`,
			})),
		};
	},
});
```

## Legality, security, saftey, and privacy

*   **Legality** This app sould be completely legal since it embedds videos from legal streaming providers (currently only YouTube). I do not provide any links to streams (except for the initial playlist containing only legal links from my friends)
*   **Security** This app is open source so you can make sure that there is no malicious code included. In addition to that there is no advertisement (... yet :-O) that could spread malicious code. But to be clear streams and streaming APIs are provided by external entites ... read more below about privacy.
*   **Safety** If you back up your playlist (and this app, it runs offline) to a file it will continue working even if this server goes down. Do back up your precius playlists now!
*   **Privacy** This app stores all your data in your browser (Menu > More tools > Developer tools > Application > IndexDB), nothing is saved on my server. I currently do not use any analytics tool (though it's very tempting). The streams however are provided by external entities (Google-YouTube) that will track you. As stated before I currently have no intentions of showing external advertisement. I think if Audius gets popular there are nicer ways to profit from it.

Web apps are true freedom! Support an open and liberal web without geo borders and login screens.

## System requirements

*   [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/download/)
*   Chrome >= 51
*   FireFox >= 49
*   Internet Explorer & Safari ... not supported, might work though

## Migration from Streamus

On Linux use [this script](https://github.com/select/audius/blob/master/src/scripts/streamus-export.sh) I created to dump the Streamus WebSql to a JSON file. The JSON can be imported using the IMPORT button below the playlist. Use the script like this:

<pre>./streamus-export.sh ~/.config/google-chrome/Profile\ 1/Local\ Storage/chrome-extension_jbnkffmindojffecdhbbmekbmkkfpmjd_0.localstorage
</pre>

Be sure to validate the JSON output, the script is just a quick hack and you might have to tweak it.

## Motivation

You are writing another music player, seriously? That's what I thought a lot when creating this, but you know ...

The extension (inactive for now) should have been the actual player since the original idea was to create a Chrome/FireFox extension with a media player for _web.whatsapp.com_. After struggeling alot with [getting the YouTube player to run in an extension content script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40309872/youtube-video-in-chrome-extension-content-script) the plan completely failed when the [content security policy](https://content-security-policy.com/) did not allow the embdding of youtube videos. Even though it should be possible to overwrite the header fields for the content security policy of web.whatsapp.com I could not get it to work (it worked on every page [except web.whatsapp.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40322156/chrome-extension-can-not-get-header-with-onheadersreceived)). That meant no YouTube player, no music. The only way out of this mess was to create an extension with a a content script (grabs links) that communicates with a background script (relays found links) that in turn communicates with the a main player (this web app, that plays the songs). But this also meant that I had to write an extension and a web app. Well what the heck, I was still using Streamus but over the time less and less worked so I needed a replacement anyway. I tried [tomahawk](https://www.tomahawk-player.org/) and it seemed quite promising, but I just could not get it to work with dragged in or paste in [youtube links](https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk-resolvers/issues/126). Also the search was quite slow and did not show many results. This kind of left me no other option but to write Audius.

As Audius evolved I tried out new technologies, one of them the Matrix chat network. Matrix is similar to email (multiple federated servers) and offers open and encryped real time data and chat message transfer. This was a fun opportunity to create a new medium for the music chat rooms that I am part of. Music chat rooms are the best way to break out of filter bubbles from services that use algorithms, they allow you to discover new music your friends and strangers curate for you.

Here are some alternatives to Audius that are also interesting:

*   [Streamly](https://lnfwebsite.github.io/Streamly)
*   [StreamSquid](http://streamsquid.com/)
*   [My Cloud Player](https://mycloudplayers.com)

Just look at them and appreciate the simplicity of the Audius interface ... wait what don't leave X-D
